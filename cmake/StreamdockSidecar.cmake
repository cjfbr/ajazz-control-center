# StreamdockSidecar.cmake — build + bundle the out-of-process mirajazz Rust
# sidecar (`streamdock-host/`) alongside the app.
#
# The AKP03 / AKP05-N4 / AKP153 Stream Dock families are driven by this sidecar
# (experiment/mirajazz). At runtime `SidecarStreamDockDevice` resolves the
# binary via QCoreApplication::applicationDirPath() + "/streamdock-host" (then
# PATH), so we (a) stage the cargo-built binary next to the app binary in the
# build tree and (b) install it beside the app for every package generator.
#
# Cargo fetches the `mirajazz` crate from git, so a network connection is needed
# at configure/build time on a clean checkout (CI has it; Flatpak builds offline
# from a vendored cargo-sources manifest — see packaging/flatpak/README).
#
# Gated by AJAZZ_BUILD_SIDECAR (default ON). If cargo is absent the build still
# succeeds (the app runs for keyboard/mouse/AKP815) but logs a loud warning —
# Stream Dock devices will fail to open until the sidecar is on PATH.

# binary post-build, and an install() rule places it beside the installed app.
